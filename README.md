This is a simple full-stack application for hot-desking business.
We have two different floors with different layouts. The functionality is booking a desk or a meeting room which makes the element red from green. 
First we need a basic DB for the two floors (resources), then a user model and a booking model.

This will be written in Typescript based on Remix framework. For DB, I will use Prisma and MongoDB.
